I wrote this for another project I work on right now, but its still far from being stable. Testing are fixes and comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nmain goal(s):\r\n* extend backbone view to automate some tasks\r\n* a must have is that views code should not contain any html markup, every bit of html should be in the template so that designers only have to touch that file\r\n* new collection view to build lists and when destroyed auto close children\r\n* new controller\r\n* views loader based on requirejs\r\n* collections batch save for all models at once\r\n\r\nfuture:\r\n* use promises\r\nhttps://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise\r\n* use shadow dom for views (polymer shadow dom polyfill)\r\nhttps://github.com/polymer/ShadowDOM\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n#ribs documentation\r\n\r\n##ribs views\r\n\r\n### onInitialize hook\r\n* if you want to do stuff during initialization of the view\r\n* don't try to append html to this.$el during onIntialize as it would get overwriten, instead use onRender\r\n\r\n### onRender hook\r\n* if you want to add programmatically stuff to the view during the rendering process use onRender\r\n\r\nfor more check out the documentation.md\r\n",
